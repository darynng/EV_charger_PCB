# EV_charger_PCB
A compact charger for powering EVs

üì¶ Overview
This project is a custom PCB power adapter designed to safely and efficiently convert 120VAC input to 400VDC output suitable for powering vehicles. It includes the key stages of a power supply system:

Rectification

Filtering

Voltage Regulation

Overcurrent Protection
